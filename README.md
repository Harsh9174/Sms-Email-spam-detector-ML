#### SMS/Email Spam Detector using Machine Learning is a powerful project designed to identify and classify spam messages in SMS and email communications. Leveraging various data cleaning techniques, this project ensures data quality and performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics. The textual messages are transformed into numerical feature vectors using vectorization techniques and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text processing and analysis.
