# Description

#### SMS/Email Spam Detector using Machine Learning is a powerful project designed to identify and classify spam messages in SMS and email communications. Leveraging various data cleaning techniques, this project ensures data quality and performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics. The textual messages are transformed into numerical feature vectors using vectorization techniques and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text processing and analysis.

# Key Features
* Data Cleaning Techniques: This project employs robust data cleaning techniques to preprocess the raw SMS and email data, ensuring high-quality data for precise and accurate predictions.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights into the dataset's characteristics with EDA techniques, enhancing the understanding of underlying patterns and trends.

* Vectorization and NLTK: Transform textual messages into numerical feature vectors using vectorization techniques, coupled with the powerful Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text processing and analysis.

* Machine Learning Models: Several machine learning models are implemented and evaluated to predict whether a given message is spam or not. The project includes popular classifiers like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Naive Bayes, providing a comparative analysis of their performance.

* Streamlit Deployment: The trained machine learning model is deployed using Streamlit, offering a user-friendly web application where users can interact with the spam detector seamlessly.
